# Movie Web Interface
A web development of a front-end interface for an SQL movie databse of two related tables (Movie and Actor). The goal of the project was to develop a user-friendly interface utilising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL functionalities; that enables users to add, search for, and remove movies and actors from the database.

## Solution & Approach
The solution took the form of a web-based application (going by the name of “Clubhouse Cinemas”). This was done using the programming languages mentioned in project description above. More specifically,
- HTML was used to create the webpage itself;
- CSS was used to control and change the presentation of HTML documents, applying styling and layout rules to specific elements;
- JavaScript was used for the client-side webpage interaction features;
- PHP in conjunction with SQL was used for form handling, file processing, and database access.

When all four languages are used together, communication between the user and the database is made easier. Each language listed includes a wide range of features that were specifically useful for this project.

The database used in the back-end development of the website was based on the structure depicted in figure above. This figure conveys an entity-relationship diagram, which gives a conceptual view of the database. This diagram aided certain design features and functionality understanding when being applied to the problem approach.
