# Movie Web Interface
A web development of a front-end interface for an SQL movie databse of two related tables (Movie and Actor). The goal of the project was to develop a user-friendly interface utilising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL functionalities; that enables users to add, search for, and remove movies and actors from the database.

This is a skeleton front-end with the hosts/usernames/passwords replaced with a placeholder, but project structure and demonstations can be seen below.
